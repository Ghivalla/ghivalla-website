  "bio": "I'm a front-end developer driven by the intersection of technology, design, and creativity. I love crafting elegant, fluid experiences that bring real value to users. What sets me apart is this combination: the creativity of an artist, the logic of a developer, and the hunger to learn of a true autodidact. I don't just code to build, I code to understand, to improve, and to give life to something meaningful.",

  "motto": "Curiosity built my path, passion keeps me on it.",
